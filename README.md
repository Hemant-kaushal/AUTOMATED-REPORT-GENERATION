# Automated Cricket Data Report Generator

## Project Overview
This project is part of my 2025 Summer Internship Task 2: Automated Report Generation.

The goal of this project is to automatically read data from a CSV file, analyze it, and generate a PDF report in a clean and structured format.
In this specific project, I have used cricket-related data (players, matches, runs, and averages) stored in a CSV file called cricket_data.csv.

The output is a PDF file named sample_report.pdf, which summarizes the key insights from the data.

## What the Project Does
Reads data from cricket_data.csv using Pandas.
Calculates:
Total number of rows and columns.
Lists all column names.
Computes summary statistics (Mean, Max, Min) for numeric columns like Runs, Matches, and Average.
Generates a PDF report using FPDF that contains:
Report Title with headers and footers.
General information (total rows, columns, column names).
Summary statistics for each numeric field.

## Technologies Used
Python 3
Pandas – For data handling and calculations
FPDF – For creating PDF reports
